# docker-dotnetcore-node
Docker image with Dotnet Core 3 slim image + Node 12

The net core image is the slim one for multistage build

> The multistage build feature helps make the process of building containers more efficient, and makes containers smaller by allowing them to contain only the bits that your app needs at run time. Multistage build is used for .NET Core projects, not .NET Framework projects.
